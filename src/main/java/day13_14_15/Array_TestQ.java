    Q01) What is Array? What kind of Data Types do we put in it? Is the Array mutable or Immutable?
         Answer: Arrays are used to store multiple data as long as the data type is the same.
                 When we create an Array we have to declare its length, so the Arrays are fixed in terms of the size.
                 We can store primitives and the references of the non-primitives data types In Arrays.
                 Arrays are immutable; because of that we cannot add or remove its elements.

    Q02) How do you check if an element exist in an Array or not?
        Answer: With the help of "binarySearch()" method
                This method returns the index of the element if the element exist in the Array
                If the element does not exist,   "binarySearch()" method returns negative and order number (It gives the
                order num according to the alphabetical order if the element would exist in the Array)

   Q03) What is MultiDimensional Array?
        Answer: If an array has arrays as elements it is called "multidimensional array"

   Q04)  What are the differences between Array and List?

        Answer: i)Array can store primitive data types and references of non-primitives
                  List can store only non-primitive data types
                ii)We have to declare first the length of the Array  when we create an Array
                  We do not have to declare the length of the List at the beginning since the Lists are flexible (They are not fixed in the length)
                iii)Arrays are immutable
                  Lists are mutable, so we can add elements and remove elements from a list
                iv)Arrays are faster and use less memory
                v)List have more useful methods than Arrays
